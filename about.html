  <h2>Who We Are</h2>
  <p>
    AI Tools Directory is an independent online platform created to help students, professionals,
    developers, entrepreneurs, and creators discover useful and trustworthy artificial intelligence tools.
    Our goal is to make it easier for people to explore modern AI technologies without confusion or technical barriers.
  </p>

  <p>
    The rapid growth of artificial intelligence has introduced thousands of new tools across writing,
    design, automation, education, marketing, and software development. While innovation is exciting,
    it can be difficult to identify which tools are genuinely helpful. AI Tools Directory exists to solve
    this problem by curating, organising, and presenting AI tools in a clear and accessible way.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    Our mission is to make artificial intelligence more approachable and practical for everyday use.
    We focus on clarity, simplicity, and usefulness so visitors can quickly understand what each tool does
    and how it may help them.
  </p>

  <ul style="margin: 20px 0 20px 20px; line-height: 1.8;">
    <li>✔ Help users discover AI tools efficiently</li>
    <li>✔ Provide clear and unbiased tool descriptions</li>
    <li>✔ Support learning, productivity, and creativity</li>
    <li>✔ Maintain a clean and user-friendly browsing experience</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How the Directory Is Maintained</h2>
  <p>
    All content on AI Tools Directory is reviewed and maintained manually. Tool listings are added,
    updated, or removed based on relevance, functionality, and usefulness. We do not accept paid
    placements or promotional rankings that could compromise the integrity of the directory.
  </p>

  <p>
    We regularly update descriptions, categories, and links to ensure accuracy. This ongoing maintenance
    helps visitors rely on the platform as a dependable reference point when exploring AI technologies.
  </p>

  <h2>Transparency & Independence</h2>
  <p>
    AI Tools Directory operates independently and is not affiliated with the companies listed unless
    explicitly stated. Any external links lead to third-party websites, and users are encouraged to
    review each tool’s own policies and terms before use.
  </p>

  <p>
    To support website hosting, development, and maintenance costs, the site may display advertisements
    through platforms such as Google AdSense. Advertising does not influence tool selection or ranking.
  </p>

  <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
  <p>
    As the platform grows, we plan to expand with additional features such as user feedback,
    educational articles, curated recommendations, and deeper insights into emerging AI trends.
    Our long-term vision is to build a reliable resource that evolves alongside artificial intelligence.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for visiting AI Tools Directory and being part of our growing community.
